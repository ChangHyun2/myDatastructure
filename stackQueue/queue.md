queue

        FIFO

        background tasks
        uploading resources
        printing / task processing


        Implementation

        array
            push / shift
            unshift / pop
        linkedList
            append / deleteHead

big O

    insertion - O(1)
    removal - O(1)
    searching - O(n)
    access - O(n)

Recap

    FIFO
    useful for processing tasks and are foundational for more complex data structures
    insertion and removal can be done in O(1)
